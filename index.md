#### May we all uphold this motto: 
> ‘We are always in the same boat, supporting each other in times of trouble. The sea of learning is endless, the tree of knowledge is flourishing, and the field of skills is profound and vast. The world is changing, challenges and hardships follow us, but we must be united to overcome the difficulties together. In the midst of the chaos and uncertainty of the future, we must also look at the big picture and reject the idea of being alone and turning our backs on others, and we must not allow ourselves to be distracted from the changes and progress of the future for the sake of a moment's comfort.’

#### Here, the free development of each person is the prerequisite for the free development of all people.

#### You can participate in any kind of learning discussion, not only limited to specific school assignments, and save, share and retrieve all kinds of learning resources.

#### You can also propose different topics, conduct research, report and publish your results in groups, or organise research teams to work on them together.

#### Warm tips:
1. Conduct constructive discussions in the library. 2.
2. make good use of the ‘Group Media’ function to search for the information you need as it may be covered by other information
3. don't be a metaphysician on the cloud, think about why your theory and knowledge is there, how it presents contradictions, and what it requires.
